<!--Problem Domain
Teach us more about you! Build out an “About Me” webpage that quizzes the user on fun facts gives the user some basic information about who you are and where you came from. We will build onto this project over the next few labs. Be prepared to refactor your code each day and learn about how a web site incrementally goes from an idea to a deployed site through various iterations of development.-->

        <p>About me, I'm from nowhere born in the storm of yestertoday and when I awoke the dust blew off the banner throttling the air above me and read <i>Kentucky</i>. I'm a veteran and studied the inside of my eyelids nightly. I've taught ESL, Martial Arts and the way for my brothers children to best rebel against the tyranny of solid parenting.
        </p>
        <p>The struggle is real my friends. our busses short or long, air bus or busted; Need our focus and attention. this is merely content. Butt. Next is Fact...
          My genuine goal in this is to learn code so that i can meditate and find a way to make this knew knowledge make my life more fullfilling. I seek autonomy and accountability in all endeavors. Perhaps in Cyber Security. Thank you for reading this far.  </p>
